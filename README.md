# Nuxt Case â€” Vacancy Overview with Filtering & Pagination

This project demonstrates a Nuxt 4 application that implements a job vacancy overview page. Users can filter and paginate through job listings, which are fetched from an external API. The goal is to showcase integration with external data sources, dynamic filtering, and efficient pagination using Nuxt 4, Nuxt Server Routes, and TailwindCSS. Optimal TypeScript support is a work in progress.

## Features
